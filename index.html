										<h2>CPU Scheduling Algorithms</h2>
									</header>
									<p>CPU scheduling is the process of choosing which process will use the CPU to carry out its execution while another is put on wait. Making ensuring that the OS at least chooses one of the processes that are available in the ready queue for execution while the CPU is idle is the primary responsibility of CPU scheduling. The CPU scheduler is in charge of the selecting process. It chooses a memory-based process that is prepared for execution.</p>

									<h3>Scheduling Algorithms</h3>
									<p>In computing, scheduling is the method by which work is assigned to resources that complete the work. The work may be virtual computation elements such as threads, processes or data flows, which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors, network links or expansion cards.
A scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity. Schedulers are often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in load balancing), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target quality of service. Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the execution model of a computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have computer multitasking with a single central processing unit (CPU). Given below are the description about <b>5</b> implemented algorithms</p>

												<h4>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</h4>
												<p>First Come First Serve is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival.
It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. 
This is managed with a FIFO queue.</p>

												<h4>Shortest Job First (SJF)</h4>
												<p>Shortest Job First is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. It is a non-preemptive and Greedy algorithm.
Shortest Job first has the advantage of having a minimum average waiting time among all scheduling algorithms.
It may cause starvation if shorter processes keep coming.</p>

												<h4>Longest Job First (LJF)</h4>
												<p>Longest Job First is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm. 
This algorithm is based upon the burst time of the processes. The processes are put into the ready queue based on their burst times i.e., in a descending order of the burst times. 
As the name suggests this algorithm is based upon the fact that the process with the largest burst time is processed first.
The burst time of only those processes is considered that have arrived in the system until that time.</p>

												<h4>Round Robin Scheduling</h4>
												<p>Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm.
Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum.
Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period.
Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.</p>
